# Hack Scripts

Use a repo-local kind kubeconfig for development and e2e tests:

```sh
./hack/kind-up.sh
export KUBECONFIG="$PWD/.kube/chill-kind.config"
```

The tracked `.envrc` points `KUBECONFIG` at `.kube/chill-kind.config` when direnv is enabled.

Do not use the testbed kubeconfig as the default shell context inside this repo. Access the testbed only with an explicit prefix:

```sh
KUBECONFIG=/path/to/testbed.kubeconfig kubectl get nodes
```

Before installing the Helm chart with `crds.enabled=true` on a shared cluster,
check CRD ownership:

```sh
make helm-crd-check
```

Use `make helm-adopt-crds` only for an intentional release migration.

Helm install and cleanup is implemented behind the repo Make targets:

```sh
make helm-install
make helm-uninstall
```

When `HELM_VALUES` names a values file, that file owns component image values;
Makefile-generated image defaults do not override it. An exact component image
can still be overridden explicitly through `OPERATOR_IMG`, `NODE_AGENT_IMG`,
`PROFILER_IMG`, or `CONSOLE_IMG` in the command environment or Make command
line.

`make helm-uninstall` treats runtime cleanup as CHILL's responsibility: it
deletes the root `ChillSystem` and waits for finalizers before calling Helm
with hooks disabled. The chart hook remains only as a safety net for direct
`helm uninstall`.

`make helm-purge-crds` is intentionally guarded and requires
`CONFIRM_PURGE_CRDS=chill`.

## Profiler runtime declarations

`charts/chill/values-profiler.yaml` takes `profiling.executionDeclarations`
only as exact-image inspection output. After the firstfloor runtime images are
pushed, list each per-platform child digest and run the generator against the
testbed:

```sh
docker manifest inspect --insecure 155.230.35.213:5000/chill/chill-firstfloor:TAG \
  | jq -r '.manifests[] | "\(.platform.os)/\(.platform.architecture) \(.digest)"'
CPU_ARM64_IMAGE=155.230.35.213:5000/chill/chill-firstfloor@sha256:... \
CPU_AMD64_IMAGE=155.230.35.213:5000/chill/chill-firstfloor@sha256:... \
CUDA_AMD64_IMAGE=155.230.35.213:5000/chill/chill-firstfloor@sha256:... \
CUDA_L4T_R32_IMAGE=155.230.35.213:5000/chill/chill-firstfloor@sha256:... \
CUDA_L4T_R35_IMAGE=155.230.35.213:5000/chill/chill-firstfloor@sha256:... \
CUDA_L4T_R36_IMAGE=155.230.35.213:5000/chill/chill-firstfloor@sha256:... \
RKNN_IMAGE=155.230.35.213:5000/chill/chill-firstfloor@sha256:... \
  hack/runtime-declarations.py > /tmp/runtime-declarations.yaml
```

The tags are `TAG` for CPU (`linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64` children),
`TAG-cuda`, `TAG-l4t-r32`, `TAG-l4t-r35`, `TAG-l4t-r36`, and `TAG-rknn`. The generator runs
one probe Pod per image in `chill-system` on a Node of the target class, with
the measurement Job's user, groups, privilege, and `nvidia.com/gpu` request. It
builds each payload from the architecture, ONNX Runtime providers, and package
versions read inside the image, reads the GPU UUID through the CUDA driver on
every GPU Node (`jetson-nano`, `jetsono`, `jetsonx`, `orin-nano`, `genesis2`, `genesis3`), and
reads the RKNPU driver version and device-tree token on `orangepi`. Every
DeviceClass receives one class-level CPU declaration; each GPU Node receives its
own CUDA declaration with `node` set, because the GPU UUID names that Node's
device, and `orangepi-5-plus-16g` adds its RKNN declaration, each when the image
variable is set. `genesis1` runs the transition observer and has no metric
source, so it is not probed.

Replace the `executionDeclarations` list in the values file with the output's
list and validate the render with
`make helm-lint helm-template HELM_VALUES=charts/chill/values-profiler.yaml`.
`hack/runtime-declarations.py --self-check` checks the payload builder offline.

## Offline observation tables

`hack/observations/` builds measurement tables from the hourly S3 observation segments: `fetch.sh <from-hour> <to-hour> <dir>` downloads them plus one hour on each side, `duckdb < hack/observations/e1.sql` in `<dir>` gives the E1 request and Tick tables, and `go run ./hack/observations/power --dir <dir>/obs --scheduler-config <scheduler ConfigMap value> --from --to` gives whole and active POOL energy with the ChillServer reducer.

`go run ./hack/kappa` prototypes the per-option capacity table with the existing scheduler replay: `-mode table` builds kappa for every option and Workload SLO, `-mode validate` replays chosen options at 0.8 to 1.2 kappa, and `-mode compare` replays recorded decisions with the kappa-sum node DP planner (`-sweep` adds the replay planner at swept loads). Results: `docs/design/serving/capacity-table-evidence.md`.
